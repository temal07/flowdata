/**
 * debug.ts — no-CLI runner for the analysis pipeline, for local iteration.
 *
 * Runs the same `analyse()` (analyse.ts) that the `flow` CLI runs and dumps
 * the result as JSON, with everything CLI/server-shaped left out — no argv
 * parsing, no viewer, no `process.exit`/browser-open/shutdown-on-keypress.
 * Exists so a new engine.ts feature can be exercised against `../tests` (or
 * any directory — change `dirToAnalyse`) with a plain `bun run`, without
 * spinning up the graph viewer.
 *
 * This file used to carry its own hand-copied duplicate of steps 1-3 of the
 * pipeline, written before analyse.ts was extracted out of flow.ts. It
 * delegates now, so an engine.ts change can't show up here and in `flow`
 * differently — which was the whole reason to reach for this script.
 *
 * Kept deliberately out of the `flow` CLI's path (see `bin` in
 * package.json) so changes here can't affect the shipped command.

// Same `import.meta.dir` approach as tree.ts.
