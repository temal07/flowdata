        Reassignment — gap 5. Note what was actually missing: in `let x; x = foo()`
        both identifiers already resolved, `x` to its declaration and `foo` to its
        function. What no one recorded is that foo's value lands in x, because only
        a declaration's initializer ever set a feed target. So this is not a
        resolution problem, it's a missing `feeds` stamp — the fix belongs here and
        not anywhere near `lookup`.

        The branch does for `x = foo()` what the VariableDeclaration branch does for
        `const x = foo()`: point currentFeedTargets at the thing being written, walk
        the right-hand side so the uses inside get stamped, then restore.

        Two details that look arbitrary and aren't:

        - `left` is walked BEFORE the target is set. Walking it after would stamp the
          write as flowing into itself, so `x = 1` would emit `x -> x`.
        - When the left side can't be named — `o.p = foo()`, or an identifier that
          resolves to nothing — the target falls back to `previous` rather than [].
          Not naming the write target says nothing about where the expression's own
          value goes, and `const a = (o.p = foo())` really does put foo's result in
          `a`. [] would throw that away.
