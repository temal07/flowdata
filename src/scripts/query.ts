/**
 * query.ts — traversal over a graph.json emitted by flow.ts.
 *
 * Usage: `vena-trace <target> [graph.json] [--back] [--strict] [--depth N] [--max N]`
 *
 * Reads the graph off disk rather than re-running the analysis, so querying
 * is decoupled from the CLI/viewer pipeline: `vena <dir>` produces the graph
 * once (see its step 5), everything here is a pure consumer of that file.
 *
 * Two questions, one traversal:
 *
 *   - Forward (default) answers "where does this value end up?"
 *       - Direct flow: an edge A -> B means some use of A fed B (a variable
 *         initializer or a call argument matched to a parameter). Following
 *         outgoing edges walks the value downstream.
 *       - Interprocedural: if a function returns the declaration we're standing
 *         on, the value escapes through that function's call sites, so we hop to
 *         the function node and keep following *its* outgoing edges.
 *   - Backward (`--back`) answers "where did this value come from?"
 *       - Direct flow: the same edges read the other way, incoming instead of
 *         outgoing.
 *       - Interprocedural: standing on a *function*, what fed it is whatever it
 *         hands back, so we step into its `returns`. That needs no reverse index
 *         — `returns` is already on the node, stamped there by engine.ts.
 *
 * The two directions are not mirror images in the code: forward needs the
 * inverted `returns` map (declaration -> functions returning it) because it
 * arrives holding a declaration, while backward arrives holding the function and
 * can read the field directly.
 *
 * Targets are addressed the same way results are printed — `file:line`, e.g.
 * `compose.ts:38`. A bare name still works, but names collide heavily in real
 * code (46 declarations named `res` in Hono), and the colliding ones are the
 * well-connected ones, so a name alone cannot reach most of the graph.
 *
 * A visited set keyed by node id keeps cycles (recursion, reassignment loops)
 * from running forever, and `--depth`/`--max` bound the output — this is meant
 * to be callable by an agent, and an unbounded trace off a hub node would fill a
 * context window on its own.
 *
 * Hops marked `~inferred` passed through a call whose callee never resolved, so
 * the flow is assumed rather than proven (gap 18). `--strict` drops them, which
 * turns the answer into a guaranteed subset of the truth instead of a guess.
